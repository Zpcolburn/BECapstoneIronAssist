## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For this project to run successfully, you'll need the following:

- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download)
- [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org)

### 1. Clone the Repo

Clone this repo using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Zpcolburn/BECapstoneIronAssist.git
```

### 2. Install Required Packages

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following commands to install the necessary packages:

```bash
dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL --version 8.0
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design --version 8.0
```

### 3. Set Up Secrets for PostgreSQL Connection

To store sensitive connection details, initialize the secret storage with:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets init
```

Then, set the connection string for your PostgreSQL database (replace with your actual PostgreSQL password):

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "BECapstoneIronAssistDbConnectionString" "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Username=postgres;Password=<your_postgresql_password>;Database=BECapstoneIronAssist"
```

### 4. Apply Migrations to the Database

Run the following command to apply the database migrations:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

This will create the necessary tables and schema in your PostgreSQL database.

### 5. Run the Solution

Launch the solution. Swagger should automatically launch and provide you with the API documentation.
